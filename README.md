# Crime Rate In Thorncliffe Park Drive

## Overview

This repo provide the data, scripts and qmd files for the paper Crime Rate In Thorncliffe Park Drive. In this study, I will investigate how the crime rate has changed over the last 10 years in Thorcliffe Park Drive. After analyzing the data we noticed that car thefts increased steadily until 2019, from where we started to see a drastic increase in auto thefts. Assaults and bike thefts have retained their average over the 10 years seeing no major increase or drop in cases. Overall, we can conclude that Thorncliffe Park has developed a problem relating to auto thefts that need to be investigated, where we either see an increase in law enforcement or auto owners taking extra precautions.
